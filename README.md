# Stock-analysis

## Project Overview
This project is to create and analyze the green stock dataset by writing macro subroutine to display the analysis data table with three columns: ticker, total daily volume, and return. Users can enter a year of 2017 or 2018 to analyze all stock tickers accordingly. The stock tickers are list by alphabet order.

 
## Results

### Stock Performance - 2017

## Summary
- Advantage of refactoring code is that it improves the stock performance while keeping the same feature/functionality
- Disadvantage is that it is time-consuming to create and complete it compared to the level of effiency or improvement that it brings. 

- The pros of using refactoring code in VBA script is it improved about a 30% overall run time improvement for the year of 2017 and 40% improvement for 2018. 
- Based on my experience, the con is that in order to make the execution time faster, it requires the input of user of arrays, which adds the complexity of keeping track in the array indexes, while writing the code.
